  <h1>Visualizing Numbers</h1>

  <p>
    The interesting phenomenon our group wants to focus on is how humans struggle to understand the scale of numbers, both large and small.
    <br>
    How much is 1000, or one million, a billion, or more? How small is e-4? or e-10?
    <br>
    Our group aims to visually illustrate how much humans underestimate these scales, and how difficult they can be to interpret without a visual guide.
